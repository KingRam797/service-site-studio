# Project Map Refresh

Inspect repository manifests and structure, then update `.agent/PROJECT_MAP.md` with verified:
- application and service entry points;
- major feature or domain directories;
- test, build, deployment, and configuration locations;
- canonical commands;
- generated or vendor paths to avoid;
- high-risk files or boundaries.

Do not invent paths or copy a full directory tree. Preserve useful project-specific notes and remove stale mappings only after verification.
